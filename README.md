# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe can be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic and interactive game. HTML sets up a 3x3 grid structure for the game board using div elements. CSS is used to style the grid and cells, ensuring the game board is visually appealing and the cells are clearly defined. JavaScript handles the game logic, including managing player moves, detecting wins or draws, and updating the board accordingly. This combination of technologies allows for a functional and engaging Tic-Tac-Toe experience directly in the web browser.
